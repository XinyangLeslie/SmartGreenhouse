Because my entire project consists of multiple parts, I've broken it up into multiple videos

- 1_MainIoTPresentation.MP4
  The first video shows the main components of my Raspberry Pi as well as the remote control of this Raspberry Pi via an IOS app, including real-time viewing of temperature, humidity, brightness, graphs over time, buttons to control different switches, and more!
  One of the highlights for me is the addition of the ability for the camera to display the video stream in real time and recognize the target for automatic recording.


- 2_LogicalTriggerMode.MP4
  The second video introduces some automatic trigger logic, such as high temperature, trigger to turn on the water pump, low brightness, automatically turn on the lights, etc.

- 3_AWSMQTTwithPartner.MP4
  This is a video to show the communication between my raspberry with my partner Nick's raspberry. The MQTT is built in the AWS instance container, which is a 24 hours working in the distance.

- 4_ThingspeakwithPartner.MP4
  This video shows me getting soil moisture data directly from my teammate's cloud by knowing his thingspeak information and displaying it on the iOS APP I designed.

- 5_AWSCloud.MP4
  This video shows my AWS cloud parts. I wrote javascript code through the frame of 'node.js' for offering the API to raspberry Pi and IOS Application

- 6_IOSApp.MP4
  This video shows my IOS development and results of connect with the Raspberry Pi.
